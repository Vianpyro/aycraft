                            <p><number>1.</number>Players must respect other players and staff. Any form of insult, discrimination, prejudice to the image of others is punished. Being courteous and polite is essential.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><number>3.</number>Spamming, preventing the correct readability of the chat is prohibited. Avoid unnecessary messages and give maximum priority to private messages.</p>

                                <number>6.</number>Anyone posting ingame or Discord messages that incite hatred of the server or bring bad mood will be punished. Aycraft is an entertainment space, any conflicts that may exist between a player and the
                                Aycraft Staff must be resolved privately.

                                <number>7.</number>Aycraft is not a dating site. DO NOT give personal information to another player (email, name, address, phone number...). Beware of disgraceful people. Never agree to meet someone you don't know in the
                                real world.

                                sanctioned even if you can prove that it was not you (as a natural person) who was using the account at the time. It is therefore strongly discouraged to lend your account/disclose your password. Nevertheless, the staff
                                reserves the right to sanction accounts sharing the same physical owner if the team deems it necessary.

                                contestable.
